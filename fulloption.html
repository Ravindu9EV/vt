            Vehicle insurance is a crucial financial safeguard that provides individuals with protection against the unforeseen risks and potential financial burdens associated with owning and operating a vehicle. The primary purpose of vehicle insurance is to mitigate the financial impact of accidents, theft, or damage to the insured vehicle. In the absence of insurance coverage, individuals would bear the full financial responsibility for repairs, medical expenses, and legal liabilities resulting from accidents.

            One of the fundamental reasons for having vehicle insurance is compliance with legal requirements. In many jurisdictions, it is mandatory to have at least a basic level of insurance coverage to operate a vehicle legally. This ensures that individuals take responsibility for their actions on the road and contributes to the overall safety of all road users.
